### Description
Get out of the waifus house is meme RPG horror 3rd person action game based in whatever place came into my mind

### Main focus
Trying to build proper game using code which would stand the test of time (impossible btw), also entertaining game with some cool features is a way to go

### Technologies
For someone who actually cares, it's kinda boring anyway: SvelteKit, TypeScript, Three.js, Rapier

### How to play?
Well hosting is out of question because bandwith would happend to be over the roof, local only. Currently you have to clone the project and run
```bash
pnpm install (recommended) OR npm install OR whatever other package manager it should work
```
Later on I plan to create desktop version out of it.

### CONTRIBUTE???
If someone is that crazy to try look into that spaghetti code you are welcome to fork the repo and create PR ü¶≠
